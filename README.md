# introducion

As i tried to build multiple vue websites with vite i had some problems. 

After a while i found this, but i don´t think its very simple to understand even if it works.

To add another site there have to be multiple acpects to do correctly or it is going to fail building.

Following the errors helped every time to see that i can´t follow my tutorial.

Hope it helps someone


## how to test the server funktionality
open folder "backend" in a console/terminal

type "npm i"

type "node .\server.js"

## how to test the vue&vite funktionality with server
open folder "frontend/viteEdit" in a console/terminal

type "npm i"

type "node "npm run build"


open folder "backend" in a console/terminal

type "npm i"

type "node .\server.js"



### Readme.md´s
backend has none, it is too simple

frontend has one with an info what the folders contain and how it works

frontend/viteEdit has a tutorial to add another site

thanks for reading
