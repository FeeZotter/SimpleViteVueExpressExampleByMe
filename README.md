# introducion

As i tried to build multiple vue websites with vite i had some problems. 

After a while i found this, but i don´t think its very simple to understand even if it works.

To add another site there have to be multiple acpects to do correctly or it is going to fail building.

Following the errors helped every time to see that i can´t follow my tutorial.

Hope it helps someone


## how to test the server funktionality
open folder "backend" in a console/terminal

type "npm i"

type "node .\server.js"

## how to test the vue&vite funktionality with server
open folder "frontend/viteEdit" in a console/terminal

type "npm i"

type "node "npm run build"


open folder "backend" in a console/terminal

type "npm i"

type "node .\server.js"

## additional stuff that gets updated

#### in frontend/root, you do nothing, that is the data build from vite

the server uses this for the website

#### in viteEdit you create the sites

read the readme in it or you are going to be lost

## how the thing works
